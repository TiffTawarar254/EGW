<h3>Theology</h3>
<h4>Christ-centered salvation by grace</h4>
<h5>The Great Controversy theme</h5>
<p>Obedience to revealed truth a sign of genuine faith</p>
<p>Jerry Moon argues that White taught assurance of salvation. Arthur Patrick believes that White was evangelical, in that she had high regard for the Bible, saw the cross as central, supported righteousness by faith, believed in Christian activism, and sought to restore New Testament Christianity.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>
<p>White's earliest essays on education appeared in the 1872 autumn editions of the Health Reformer.[39] In her first essay she stated that working with youthful minds was the most delicate of tasks. The manner of instruction should be varied. This would make it possible for the "high and noble powers of the mind"[39] to have a chance to develop. To be qualified to educate the youth (she wrote), parents and teachers must have self-control, gentleness and love.</p>

<p>White's idea of creating a Christian educational system and its importance in society is detailed in her writings Christian Education (1893, 1894) and Education (1903).</p>

<h4>Health reform</h4>
<p>
White expounded greatly on the subjects of health, healthy eating and a balanced diet. In her book Counsels on Diet & Foods, she gives advice on the right foods and on moderation. She also warns against the use of tobacco, which was medically accepted in her day. Her views are expressed in the writings Healthful Living (1897, 1898) and The Health Food Ministry (1970) and The Ministry of Healing (1905).</p>
